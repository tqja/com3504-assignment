Welcome to the floraExplorer plant sightings web application. You can post your latest plant sightings with other plant connoisseurs to discuss with each other. You can also post a plant and get its name from our live chat in each photo. Please feel free to post all your plant findings, explore new plants, and share your sightings with others!
floraExplorer is a webapp implemented for the Univerity of Sheffield COM3504 assignment by group BSc15.
## Features

Users must also post a photo of the plant.

- Users can interact with one another to allow them to discuss the plants, and in the scenario where a user needs help in identifying a plant other users may make suggestions in the livechat of the sighting.

- A find my location feature which can detect where the user currently is and submit the forms location for them
